# KidGame

Simple python3 text adventure game for kids to modify.  Also my first Python experience of any size.

If you want your kids to try it out, clone the files, then open creature.py, and let them add a creature of their own imagining.

Note - if you'd like to contribite, try to make sure there aren't any dependancies on installation libraries.  This should be *super* simple to install and get going.  We shouldn't have to preface with, first install X, then install Y, then check... you get the point. ;) 

## To Run...

>python3 game.py

Unless you have python mapped to python3, then its just:

>python game.py
>                                                                                                  
>                                                                                                  
>P                                                                                                  
>                                                                                                   
>
